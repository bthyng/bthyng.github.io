        <h1>What is this all about?</h1>
        <p>Day By Day is an effort in self care. Upon entering grad school, enduring a breakup, and moving 13 hours from where I called home; I found myself forgetting to eat or drink water throughout the day. To give myself a gentle reminder to take care of myself I carry a little card to track my progress.
        </p>
        <p>
        The front of the card asks the same thing everyday:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Did you eat today?</li>
            <li>Did you drink H2o?</li>
            <li>How are you feeling today?</li>
            <li>Goal for the day?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        And the back is a place for me to reflect what I am thankful for that day.
        </p>
        <p>
        This is a space for the cards and the things I am thankful for to live after they are completed each day.
